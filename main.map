This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n     * controls\n     * (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can be\n     * animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state such\n     * as user input.\n     *\n     * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n     * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n     * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n     * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n     * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted). This is an expensive operation and should\n     * be avoided if possible.\n     *\n     * To customize the default tracking algorithm, `NgFor` supports `trackBy` option.\n     * `trackBy` takes a function which has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n     * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n     *\n     * ### Syntax\n     *\n     * - `<li *ngFor=\"let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n     * - `<li template=\"ngFor let item of items; let i = index; trackBy: trackByFn\">...</li>`\n     *\n     * With `<template>` element:\n     *\n     * ```\n     * <template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\" let-i=\"index\" [ngForTrackBy]=\"trackByFn\">\n     *   <li>...</li>\n     * </template>\n     * ```\n     *\n     * ### Example\n     *\n     * See a [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/KVuXxDp0qinGDyo307QW?p=preview) for a more detailed\n     * example.\n     *\n     * \\@stable\n     */\n    var NgFor = (function () {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} _viewContainer\n         * @param {?} _template\n         * @param {?} _differs\n         * @param {?} _cdr\n         */\n        function NgFor(_viewContainer, _template, _differs, _cdr) {\n            this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n            this._template = _template;\n            this._differs = _differs;\n            this._cdr = _cdr;\n            this._differ = null;\n        }\n        Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTrackBy\", {\n            /**\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            get: function () { return this._trackByFn; },\n            /**\n             * @param {?} fn\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            set: function (fn) {\n                if (_angular_core.isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                    // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n                    if ((console) && (console.warn)) {\n                        console.warn((\"trackBy must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn) + \". \") +\n                            \"See https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/common/index/NgFor-directive.html#!#change-propagation for more information.\");\n                    }\n                }\n                this._trackByFn = fn;\n            },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        Object.defineProperty(NgFor.prototype, \"ngForTemplate\", {\n            /**\n             * @param {?} value\n             * @return {?}\n             */\n            set: function (value) {\n                if (value) {\n                    this._template = value;\n                }\n            },\n            enumerable: true,\n            configurable: true\n        });\n        /**\n         * @param {?} changes\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        NgFor.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n            if ('ngForOf' in changes) {\n                // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n                var /** @type {?} */ value = changes['ngForOf'].currentValue;\n                if (!this._differ && value) {\n                    try {\n                        this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this._cdr, this.ngForTrackBy);\n                    }\n                    catch (e) {\n                        throw new Error(\"Cannot find a differ supporting object '\" + value + \"' of type '\" + getTypeNameForDebugging(value) + \"'.
