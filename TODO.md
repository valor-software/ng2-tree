- It should be possible to override menu icons and items, remove/hide existing menu items, add user handlers for particular menu items.
- It should be possible to override tree node styles, icons, collapse-expand on a node level.
- Support mobile devices:
  - Styling on mobile.
  - Detect current issues and pain using ng2-tree on mobile devices.
  - Expose API for managing tree programmatically (expand, collapse, new node, etc.).
